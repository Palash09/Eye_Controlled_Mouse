# Eye_Controlled_Mouse
In this python script I am trying to control the mouse with the help of my eyes. 
It is implemented with the help of computer vision.

With the help of computer vision techniques and numpy library, I have implemented a model for controlling the mouse with the help
of eye pupil i.e. if we move the eye then the pointer of mouse will also move.

Soon I'll be adding more advanced features to it.
